UnityUnitTesting
================

Unity editor extension for running unit tests (NUnitLite) and displaying their results.

Uses NUnitLite: http://nunitlite.org/

To use, simply add the project files to your existing Unity project. Iâ€™ve tested this with Unity 4.0 upwards. It should be fine in earlier versions too.

The tool can be configured to run the unit tests automatically for you upon project source changes. To run tests manually from within Unity go to:
Window -> UnitTesting -> Run All Unit Tests

To display the results window, go to:
Window -> UnitTesting -> Show Window
